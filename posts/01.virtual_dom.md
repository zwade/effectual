# Effectual JS Pt 1: Rend(er) Me Asunder

If we're going to build a full JavaScript framework from scratch, we need to start somewhere. Personally, I like having tangible results up front, so apropos of little else, let's start with our rendering engine.

^^^

## You Keep Using That Word...

When I use the term render, you might immediately call to mind a college graphics course where you brute forced some matrices to draw a triangle on your screen.

In the web development world, however, we ==usually== don't mean it in that context. Instead, rendering often refers to the problem of taking our code and converting it to something that can be displayed in the browser.

Specifically, ==rendering is the process by which JavaScript components are converted into an HTML representation.== This process is necessary in any web development framework, and will be the first thing we tackle in Effectual.

Ok well, I mean yeah we also use it in that context too. Just not in the context of the context I'm contextualizing.
